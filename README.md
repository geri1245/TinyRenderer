# A small rendering engine using Rust and WebGPU

This repository was created as a learning project to implement some graphics algorithms using Rust and WebGPU.

## Features

- Rendering obj models
- Live shader recompilation
- Physically based rendering with HDR environment maps (only diffuse IBL is implemented)
- Point and directional lights
- Shadows

## Future plans

- Soft shadows
- Cascaded shadow maps
- Level editor functionalities (saving and loading levels)
- Screen space reflections
- Global illumination
- Grass rendering
- Water rendering
